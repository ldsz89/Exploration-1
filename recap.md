# Exploration 1: Rendering a webpage as a desktop application

1. Links to Documentation (Sources)  
Electron (https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/): contains documentation on getting started with Electron by downloading required packages such as node js  
Creative-Tim (https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard): theme used to prove concept
2. Components I explored:  
I decided to explore turning a webpage into a desktop application. Electron is a framework that allows you to write desktop applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Troubleshooting:  
Unfortunately I was unable to get Electron working on a Windows machine however, working in a Linux environment produced no errors.
4. Code:  
Github repo: https://github.com/ldsz89/Exploration-1
5. Recap:  
For this exploration I decided to look into making desktop applications using the Electron framework. After getting a basic idea of what exactly Electron is from their video, I went through how to use it from their quick start guide. To make Electron work, I had to make sure to have node js installed.  After that, I cloned the quick start repository, installed the required dependencies, and ran the default quick start page. Next I wanted to test CSS so I used condensed a theme (Links to an external site.) I'd used before.
